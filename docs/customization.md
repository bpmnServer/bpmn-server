# Integration into your Application

In this document, we discuss how to integrate your application with bpmn-server.

**bpmn-server** package is a NodeJs package requires an application as a front-end and to customize the workflow logic

We provide a sample demo application in **[bpmn-web](https://github.com/bpmnServer/bpmn-web)** as a github template

To deliver a complete workflow, you need to customize the bpmn-web to suite your needs or you can have your own app to be the front-end of the workflow.

We assume that you are already familiar with setting up bpmn-server along with your processes and having them running.

Please note code in this page is for illustration purposes only.
